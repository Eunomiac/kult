Experiment with the Tarot cards and discover how they can be used to serve your story."],["ADOPT THE MINDSET","You should be in the right mindset when utilizing the Tarot cards. The ritual is important, not to attract supernatural attentions, but rather to encourage your subconscious to engage with the cards as creative inspiration, as a way to unlock the labyrinths of your imagination.

Center your thoughts on the dark potential of the KULT universe."],["FOCUS ON YOUR QUESTION","About what in your campaign are you hoping to find guidance?
